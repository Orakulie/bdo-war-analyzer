This tool allows easy scanning of combat logs. Just upload your screenshots and let the website handle the rest.

# Screenshot format
To achieve the best results you will need to take the screenshots in the following format:
- only dislpay combat messages
- background transparency to 100
- font size to normal
- show timestamps

# Disclaimer
This was one of my first Vue projects. It works, but the code is pretty rough. It will need a rewrite if there is any demand for additional features.
